This fork of vim-scripts/jsbeautify has a couple small changes.

a plugin to format your javascript souce code


A js version can be found at:
http://jsbeautifier.org/


usage:
  <leader>ff
or
  bind the g:Jsbeautify() function to any short key you like

Changes:
It is filetype plugin so it only loads for javascript files. This might not be ideal if you want to reformat .json files or use the javascript.jquery filetype.


Thanks to aj3423 fork creating the vimscript version of this brilliant reformatter.
